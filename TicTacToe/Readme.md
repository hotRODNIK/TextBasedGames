# TicTacToe
An extremely simple implementation of TicTacToe in Java. This project can be compiled using Java 8 or higher, and requires no external libraries or dependencies.
I have included a simple testing script as well that may come in useful when debugging. 

# To Compile and Run:
```
javac TicTac.java
java TicTac
```
